//api -> in simple words it allows two different apps to talk to each other it's just a middle person that makes frontend to interact with database
  
// Sample GET API route
app.get('/api/notes', (req, res) => {
  res.send('API is working so we can start saurabh baby you are looking very handsome today !');  // Response on hitting the route
});

// Sample POST API route
